# Client
## Bypassing
Right now, most of it's modules do not bypass NCP/WatchDog. The ones which do are:
 - Autoclicker
 - Velocity
 - Fastplace
 There are others which do bypass, because they can't be considered hacks, such as sprint, and obviously, all visuals (under the render tab bypass).
 
 ## Module List
 ### Combat
  - AntiBot
  - AutoClicker
  - Velocity
 ### Movement
  - Sprint
  - Fly
 ### Player
  - Fastplace
  - NoFall
 ### Render
  - Fullbright
  - HUD
 ### Misc
  - SafeSettings
  - SelfDestruct

 ## Trust
 This client is safe, and you can confirm this by going through the source code.<br>
 I have [a lot](https://github.com/Kopamed/Galacticc/projects/1 "roadmap") planned for this client, and ruining both my and it's reputation would just be a dumb thing to do in this case. <br>If you still do not belive me, join the discord and you can see all the vouches for yourself.
 
 ### Feel free to contribute code!
